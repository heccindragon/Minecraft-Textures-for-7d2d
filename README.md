# Minecraft-Textures-for-7d2d
This mod adds minecraft textures to 7d2d as well as some changes to some loot and crafting recipes for Undead Legacy! Well... it doesn't change every block texture but some!!!

NOTICE: FOR THE TEXTURE PART OF THIS MOD TO WORK YOU WILL NEED THE MODS SS_TERRAIN AND SPHERELL LEGACY DISTANT TERRAIN MOD AND YOU'LL NEED UNDEAD LEGACY IF YOU
WISH TO HAVE THE CHANGES ADDED FOR UNDEAD LEGACY


1. Add the mod "UndeadLegacy_zMiscellanious changes" to your mods folder in 7d2d.
2. Add the resources folder to "SS_Terrain/Resources" and replace the folder currently there.

You should be all good now :D or I messed up my instructions and it doesn't work :(
